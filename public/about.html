<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello to everyone. My name is Aykhan. Despite the fact that I am new to web programming,<br/> I have a bachelor's degree in "Cyber Security." I am now pursuing a master's degree in "Economic Informatics." <br/>My higher education study of the role of informatics in the economy helps me more readily open doors in the global arena.</p>
